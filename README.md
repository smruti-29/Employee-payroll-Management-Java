Employee Payroll Management System
The Employee Payroll Management System is a Java-based project that demonstrates the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation. This system allows efficient management of employee data, including payroll calculations and record-keeping.

Features:
Add Employee: Add new employees with detailed information such as name, designation, and salary details.
Calculate Payroll: Calculate monthly payroll for employees based on their designations and other allowances.
Update Employee Details: Modify existing employee information including name, designation, and salary components.
View Employee Information: Retrieve and display detailed information about employees in the system.
Polymorphism: Implement different payroll calculation methods based on employee types (e.g., regular employees, contractors).
Abstraction: Utilize abstract classes and methods for defining common behavior and ensuring consistency across employee types.
Inheritance: Create specialized employee classes inheriting common properties and methods from a base class.
Encapsulation: Encapsulate employee data within classes, allowing controlled access and modification through public methods.
Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language used for the project, applying various OOP principles.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Concepts like polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation are implemented for efficient code organization.
User Interface (UI): Basic command-line interface for user interaction.
Data Management: Data structures and classes for managing employee records and payroll calculations.
